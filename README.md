Getting started with Heroku; reading through https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python?singlepage=true , but with GitHub instead of Heroku CLI.  Upgraded OSX's python via `brew update` and `brew upgrade`, then installed django via `python -m pip install Django` following https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/ 's link for django.
